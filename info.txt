the 300x300 data set doesn't works even after 0.85 dominant ratio is that
ram takes so much time to get to the IBFS that it just cannot be fast

In large transportation problems, initial solution construction time
dominates total runtime. Although RAM yields better initial solutions
and fewer MODI iterations, its higher computational overhead makes 
VAM + MODI faster overall, so RAM + MODI cannot be guaranteed superior 
in large-scale cases. (by large we mean m or n greater than 200)
