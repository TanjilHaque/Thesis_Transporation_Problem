For very large transportation problems (𝑚 or 𝑛 > 200), 

the 300×300 dataset performs poorly even with a dominant ratio of 0.85.

Russell’s Approximation Method (RAM) takes excessive time to construct the Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS).

As problem size increases, initial solution construction time dominates total runtime.

Although RAM often yields better initial solutions and fewer MODI iterations, its computational overhead is high.

As a result, VAM + MODI is generally faster overall for large-scale problems.

Therefore, RAM + MODI cannot be guaranteed to be superior in large transportation problems.
